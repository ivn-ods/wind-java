    <h3>About the project</h3>
    <p> wind.od.ua is a project for monitoring wind speed and direction online by weather stations at various points in the Odessa region. Although it was conceived for kiting, it is perfect for various sports where wind speed is important - for windsurfing, paragliding, parachuting, yachting, etc. </p>
    <p>The wind speed measurement at the spot is carried out by self-developed solar-powered Internet weather stations with data transmission using the GSM network.
        The minimum, average, and maximum wind speed is calculated for 15 minutes at a 20-second time interval.
        Data is transmitted to the server via GPRS once every 5-15 minutes in normal mode depending of wind speed and solar energy and once every 1 hour at night.</p>
    <p>The air temperature in the sun is also measured</p>
    <p>At the moment, GSM weather stations are installed in Koblevo (all directions), Luzanovka (directions from S to E), Sergeevka (all directions). </p>
